
#A retailer wants to price three different styles of sweaters. 
#Each sweater can be priced among the following five price points {$24.9, $29.9, $34.9, $39.9, $44.90}. 
#For each sweater and price-point combination, the retailer expects the demand to be as given in the table below.


#Prices ($)	Sweater Style 1	Sweater Style 2	Sweater Style 3
#24.9	150	170	250
#29.9	135	75	220
#34.9	120	60	190
#39.9	100	45	100
#44.9	60	40	90

#For example, if sweater style 1 is price at $44.90 then the retailer expects to sell 60 of these sweaters in the market.

#The retailer wants to find the optimal price for each sweater style such that their total revenue is maximized and the following constraints are satisfied:
  
#C1. Average price of the three sweater styles is less than or equal to $29.9.
#C2. Sweater style 1 cannot be priced lower than sweater style 2.
#C3. Sweater style 2 cannot be priced lower than sweater style 3.

#Formulate and solve the retailerâ€™s price optimization problem as an integer program.
